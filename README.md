 # NC State Jobs Review System
 
This is a Flask App for NCSU Campus Job Review System with SQL database for storage. Here students from NCSU can view reviews on all different jobs that are available on campus. The aim of the portal is to help students get a closer understanding of the job description and the work, as experienced by fellow students. The website allows the students to upload reviews for others to view. The anonymity of the students is maintained to let them upload honest reviews.

# Quick look to the newly added features

## A Potential Game Changer
* Comprehensive Filters for Customized View: The reviews are distinctly filtered out based on the categories of location and company which enhances the user experience in viewing the desired reviews. The advanced search filter provides tightly-focused and incredibly faster means to zone in on their choices.
* Optimized the server processing performance using Pagination feature: The significant server traffic control and latency is constrained in limits using the pagination strategies. Effective pagination strategies have been devised to smoothly render the data from the dense database which could potentially return millions and billions.
* Powerful Querying and Analytics using MongoDB: The MongoDB query facilitates to query deep into documents and performs complex analytics pipelines with minimal resources. It's flexible document schema integrated with rapid query operations offer a significant performance boost when compared to the previously used traditional databases.
